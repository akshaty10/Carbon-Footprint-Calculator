User-Friendly Interface: Built using the Streamlit library, providing an interactive, easy-to-navigate interface.
Machine Learning Integration: Emission computations based on machine learning algorithms, offering accurate and real-time carbon factors.
Customizable Settings: Users can update values based on personal data such as distance traveled, vehicle types, and energy consumption.
Impactful Carbon Credits: Future plans include integration of carbon credit purchasing, focusing on removal credits from reforestation and other nature-based sequestration methods.
Objectives
Achieve 90% reduction in emissions by 2025 through user engagement.
Commit to planting 5 million trees to offset carbon footprints.
Assist individuals and organizations in achieving carbon neutrality by providing a clear path to decarbonization.
Factors Involved in Calculation
1. Transportation
Distance Traveled: Emissions based on distance (coefficient: 0.14 per unit distance).
Fuel Efficiency: More fuel-efficient vehicles emit fewer emissions (coefficient: 0.05).
Vehicle Types: Cars (0.12), Vans (0.15), Buses (0.2), Bicycles (0.0).
Fuel Types: Gasoline (2.31), Diesel (2.66), Electric (0.0).
2. Electricity Consumption
Consumption (kWh): Emissions based on kilowatt-hours consumed (coefficient: 0.82).
Energy Sources: Coal (1.5), Natural Gas (0.8), Renewables (0.0).
Efficiency and Renewable Usage: Higher efficiency and renewable energy sources lower emissions.
3. Diet
Food Types: Meat-based (5.0), Vegetarian (2.0), Vegan (1.5).
Food Waste Reduction: Reducing food waste lowers overall emissions.
Local Sourcing: Locally sourced ingredients have lower carbon footprints.
4. Industrial Processes
Material Usage: Quantity of materials impacts emission levels.
Industry Types: Manufacturing (1.5), Textile (2.0), Chemical (2.5).
Production Processes: Processes like Casting (0.5) and Machining (0.3) vary in emissions.
Clean Technology: Cleaner technologies reduce industrial emissions.
